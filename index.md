# Welcome to Arya Mazloomi's Github Page!

As a previous Electrical Engineering student and current Computer Science learner, I like to share my experience with all of my friends around the world (anyone who is crazy enough to learn new things is considered as friend :) ) 
The purpose of this page is to introduce you my Github projects briefly. you can find all projects in the following code block. Also you can access my personal blog and my podcast (That's right! I'm hosting a Tech Podcast as well!) from [here](https://digi-podcast.tech/). 

### My Projects
